CS 230 8-2 - David A. DiPesa, Journal Assignment
-------------------------------------------------

Our client, The Gaming Room, asked us to assist in developing a web-based game application called, “Draw It or Lose It.”  Being web-based, they required their software to be fast rendering, easy-to-use and be housed in an environment that was secure, to protect their users’ data and control the level of access to the game.

When developing documentation for this project, I think I did a good job of researching all of my requirements.  I hunted down my requirements based on price, reliability and current trends within the online video gaming industry.  I’m proud of the research I put into doing the design documentation and I hope that our client was also happy.

The design document helped in understanding the defined parameters of the code.  We have a UML class diagram which shows us exactly what we need to do.  Also, defining our constraints also helped by showing us the unknowns before we start to develop code.  

I would change the Evaluation section.  By leaving it as I have presently, it’s cluttered and I would want to clean it up so that there was nothing ambiguous or unimportant.  I feel like it rambles too much for my taste.

I interpret the user’s needs by being someone who is typically a user in the online gaming world.  I looked at the things that I felt weren’t favorable to me about online games and tried to see where improvements could be made to help this particular game rise above.  It’s important to consider the users' needs because, in the end, they are the ones who buy the product.  They are the voice of this product.  If there’s a feature that’s not working well or not wanted then you can rest assured that the users will find them.  They will point them out and that could make or break your game in the long run.
