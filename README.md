CS 230 8-2 - David A. DiPesa, Journal Assignment
-------------------------------------------------

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Our client, The Gaming Room, asked us to assist in developing a web-based application called, “Draw It or Lose It.”  Being web-based, they required their software to be fast rendering, easy-to-use and to be housed in an environment that was secure, to protect their users’ data and control the level of access to the game.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

When developing documentation for this project, I think I did a good job of researching all of my requirements.  I hunted down my requirements based on price, reliability and current trends within the online video gaming industry.  I’m proud of the research I put into while doing the design documentation and I hope that our client was also pleased.  I have to admit there were moments when I felt lost.  However, I kept researching and trying until I was satisfied with my results.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document helped in understanding the defined parameters of the code.  We have a UML class diagram which shows us exactly what we need to do.  Also, defining our constraints also helped by showing us the unknowns before we start to develop code.  Without these factors, deveolping code would have been less effective and not accurate.  

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would change the Evaluation section of the design document.  By leaving it as I have presently, it’s just too cluttered and I would want to clean it up so that there was nothing ambiguous or unimportant.  I feel like it rambles too much for my taste.   Also, I did not like the formatted table as it was really annoying to work within those tables.  I would definitely change that to a more traditional style of document much like how everything else was laid out on the document.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpret the user’s needs by being someone who is typically a user in the online gaming world.  I looked at the things that I felt weren’t favorable to me about online games and tried to see where improvements could be made to help this particular game rise above.  It’s important to consider the users' needs because, in the end, they are the ones who are in charge of the product.  They are the voice of this product.  If there’s a feature that’s not working well or not wanted then you can be rest assured that the users will find them.  They will point them out and that could make or break your game in the long run.  Lastly, in my experiences, customers want what they want without much room for compromise.  So, giving your customer what they are paying for is the ideal scenario, always.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach for designing the software was largely based on the desires of the client.  Sure, I had my own input, but their needs are what drove my choices for the final product.  I may not have thought about making the same choices had it been something for just myself.  So, the design document, which I have used at one of my previous jobs, was a great tool for focusing efforts on client wants and needs.  Using the design document is a great start for future projects.  We can build the foundation with it.  Also, we can use the strategy of building a small portion of the code and showing them how it would run differently with a few options.  I think that clients like to see what they’re getting, or could get, before anything is actually built.  

I have a project at work where we made a real-life mockup of what the client would receive and then showed them the full potential with a 3D CAD model alongside it.  That was a good experience and gave everyone something valuable to takeaway.  If I made a similar application as Draw It or Lose It, I would focus on the rendering of the drawings as a strategy.  That seems to be the one component that would make or break the game.  So, going over the rendering speed and how to make it the best it can be, would sell our services well.
